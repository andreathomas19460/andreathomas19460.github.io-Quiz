# Quiz with Timer

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a timed multiple choice quiz using Javascript. 
The quiz is designed to penalize the user 15 seconds for every incorrect answer.
The user is prompted to select an answer from the choices list. The user gets a notification on whether or not their selection is correct. Quiz has a highscores log with a button to clear the scores. 
This page is formatted to be responsive to multiple viewports. 

## Components

The webpage is comprised of:

1. A "Start Quiz" page: a multiple choice quiz generates on this page 
2. A "Highscores" page: scores should be stored locally with user initials and displayed here

## Deployment

Webpage can be found at this link: https://andreathomas19460.github.io/andreathomas19460.github.io-Quiz/

1. A "Start Quiz" page: the user can navigate to the Highscores page or start the quiz
2. Multiple choice questions load one at a time/per answer submission
3. At the end of the quiz, the user receives their score and can log that score with their initials to local storage
4. If the user clicks the Log Score button, they are taken to the Highscores page
5. The highscores page should display the logged scores with the user's initials
6. The "Clear Scores" button should clear all scores from local storage

## Note 

This project is not fully functional. The javascript does not allow the Highscores page to display the score & initials combinations. This might indicate that scores are not being saved/accessed locally. Page links, quiz, and score generation are functional.
